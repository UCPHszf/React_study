        1.Virtual DOM:
            Virtual dom keeps some basic property of real dom,such as tag,props,
            hierarchy relationship
        2.Diff algorithm:
            Based on three strategies:React designed its diffing algorithm.
            i.The across-hierarchy movement of the dom element is few
            ii.For the two component generated by the same class,React would generate analogous tree structure
            iii.For the child node in the same hierarchy,they can be distinguished by unique i.

            Tree diff
            Compare both the old and new dom tree.If a node disappear by compared,the node and its child would be
            deleted.For nodes in different hierarchy,there are only DELETE and CREATE operation.So it's supposed to
            process across-hierarchy operation

            Component diff
            If two components have the same type,use tree diff.Or the component would be marked as dirty component and
            be replaced all its child node.

            Element diff
            For the node in the same hierarchy,we can add a unique key to distinguish the node.Thus, when compared
            the node,if they have the same key,React would process move operation rather than generate after delete.

            Key selection
            It is not advised to use index as the key value.Since the creation or deletion operation might change the
            index.
